```javascript
// Check your PurgeCSS configuration.  Ensure you have correctly configured the `content` option to include all necessary files.  Common mistakes include:
// 1.  Incorrect paths to your template files.
// 2.  Forgetting to include files where the important classes are used.
// 3.  Not using the correct glob patterns to match your files.

// Example: 
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './src/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // your tailwind config
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

// If you're using a framework, make sure that the classes are properly included in the framework's build process.

// If the classes are dynamically generated, you might need to use a custom PurgeCSS extractor or alternative strategies.
